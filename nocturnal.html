                <h2>Bats</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    Bats are the only mammals capable of sustained flight. They help control insect populations through their diet of insects, and some species also pollinate plants and disperse seeds. Bats use echolocation to navigate and hunt in the dark, making them highly adapted for nocturnal life.
