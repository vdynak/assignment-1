                <h2>Scarlet Ibis</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    The Scarlet Ibis is a stunning tropical bird renowned for its vibrant red plumage. Native to the wetlands and mangroves of South America, this bird is often seen wading in shallow waters, where it forages for food. Its bright color, which comes from the carotenoids in its diet, makes it one of the most striking birds in the tropical regions. The Scarlet Ibis has a long, slender bill adapted for hunting in mud and shallow water. It typically feeds on a diet of crustaceans, insects, and small fish. Despite its bright red appearance, the Scarlet Ibis is well-adapted to blending into its wetland habitat, providing it with both camouflage and protection.

                <h2>Kakapo</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    The Kakapo, also known as the owl parrot, is a flightless parrot native to New Zealand. Distinguished by its large size, nocturnal habits, and distinctive green feathers with black and yellow markings, the Kakapo is a unique and critically endangered species. As one of the heaviest parrots in the world, it relies on its strong legs and claws to navigate its forested habitat rather than flying. The Kakapo has a distinctive, owl-like face with large, expressive eyes, enhancing its nocturnal vision. Its diet primarily consists of fruits, seeds, and flowers. The Kakapo's population has dwindled drastically due to habitat loss and predation by introduced species. Conservation efforts have been pivotal in increasing its numbers, but it remains critically endangered, with a small, carefully monitored population.
